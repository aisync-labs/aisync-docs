Under the initial phase of the official Genesis Spark program, AISYNC will provide additional airdrops to users identified as having valuable data contributions. In the Solana ecosystem, we implement incentive policies based on the value contributions made by users to prominent projects. Specifically, all users who have engaged in transactions or other valid interactions with the **\$TRUMP** or **\$MELANIA** tokens are eligible for an **\$AIS** token airdrop.

This airdrop policy is determined by the Trading Scoring Agent's comprehensive evaluation of user activities. The system automatically assigns the number of airdrops each participant can receive based on their assessed contributions. We assure that all airdrop tokens are repurchased from the market by the official team, ensuring that there will be no adverse impact on market trading prices.

We encourage all users to actively participate in our project to foster the growth and prosperity of the ecosystem. Your engagement not only helps propel the ecosystem forward but also offers the opportunity for substantial rewards.

If you have any questions or believe your account should be eligible for an airdrop, please reach out via direct message to our official Twitter account [@aisync_labs](https://x.com/aisync_labs).
