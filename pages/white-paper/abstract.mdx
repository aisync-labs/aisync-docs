## Abstract

In a future shaped by both blockchain and artificial intelligence, Agents (autonomous software entities) will become increasingly central in a wide range of applications—from decentralized finance (DeFi) to investment research and beyond. **AISYNC** aims to be a universal Agent platform that aggregates multi-source data (on-chain transactions, centralized exchange data, specialized data sets) and leverages state-of-the-art AI algorithms (deep learning, reinforcement learning, multi-agent learning) to train and deploy Agents across various domains. Through a robust scoring and incentive model, AISYNC encourages users to share high-quality data and contribute domain expertise, creating a self-evolving ecosystem. **AIS** is the platform’s native token, used for rewarding user contributions, staking in the Agent marketplace, and sharing in the platform’s revenue streams.
