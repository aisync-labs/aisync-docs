### Platform Positioning

- **Data Aggregation Hub**  
  The platform supports the integration of multi-source data both on-chain (e.g., Solana, EVM, Polkadot, etc.) and off-chain (e.g., Binance, research analysis data, other business data, etc.), providing high-quality and diverse data for Agent training.

- **Agent Platform**  
  Users can create or deploy their own Agents on the platform. Agents are capable of executing automated trading, investment research analysis, market monitoring, and even more generalized intelligent applications.

- **Incentives and Revenue Sharing**  
  Through a token economy model, users can earn points and airdrop rewards. Top-performing Agents can be made available to others in the "Market Center," earning additional profit shares based on performance metrics and risk control indicators.
