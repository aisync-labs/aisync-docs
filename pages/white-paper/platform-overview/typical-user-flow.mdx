### Typical User Flow

- **Registration and Wallet Binding**
   - Users register on the platform and bind their wallet addresses; if they have centralized exchange (CEX) data, they can authorize it with an API Key.
- **Data Contribution or Usage**
   - Top traders, research teams, and other users can choose to share their on-chain or off-chain trading data and receive basic incentives.
- **Agent Training and Deployment**
   - Users can utilize the platform's training frameworks (supporting deep learning, reinforcement learning, AutoML, etc.) to create Agents.
   - Users can fine-tune the style of custom Agents; for instance, top traders can use their own data to fine-tune existing Agents, creating personalized automated trading strategies.
- **Scoring and Points**
   - The platform assigns scores based on multiple dimensions, including wallet address, data contribution, interactions, and operations.
   - Higher scores result in greater points and airdrop quotas.
- **Market Center Listing**
   - Agents that have completed training or testing can be listed in the platformâ€™s "Market Center"; other users can subscribe to or use these Agents and pay the associated fees.
- **Revenue Sharing**
   - Profits from Agents (such as trading profits and subscription income) are distributed according to the contract to the Agent creators and other stakeholders.
