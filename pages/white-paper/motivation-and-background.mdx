## Motivation and Background

As the blockchain industry rapidly evolves, tens of thousands of traders and developers have emerged within the decentralized ecosystem. Simultaneously, advancements in artificial intelligence—particularly large language models and deep reinforcement learning—have opened new possibilities for automated agents. However, effectively aggregating and utilizing multi-source data to train models for creating more autonomous agents and ensuring their safe, efficient operation in decentralized environments pose several challenges:

1. **Data Scarcity and Quality Issues**  
   - Traditional trading or investment research systems often rely on dispersed and unstructured historical data. Although blockchain data is publicly transparent, it suffers from homogeneity and significant label noise; off-chain applications like centralized exchanges (CEX) or institutional research data face accessibility barriers.
   - Our platform addresses these issues by designing a "user-contributed data" + "platform incentive" model, aggregating high-quality data from active participants, traders, research teams, and industry experts both on-chain and off-chain to provide robust samples for training various agents.

2. **Algorithm Complexity and Lack of Universality**  
   - Existing trading bots are often restricted to specific blockchains or trading strategies, hindering their adaptability.
   - We introduce methods such as "Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)" and "Hierarchical Policy Networks" to enable agents to make transferable, intelligent decisions across various scenarios and dimensions.

3. **Decentralization and Incentive Mechanisms**  
   - Ensuring that all parties can fairly gain benefits and maintain enthusiasm in a decentralized setting remains a question.
   - The platform leverages a verifiable scoring system, points and token incentives, along with a subsequent "revenue sharing" plan to foster an ecosystem where spontaneous collaboration and competition coexist.


In summary, our platform aims to lay the foundation for a ubiquitously intelligent future by developing a comprehensive system of data aggregation, algorithm training, scoring, and incentive mechanisms, facilitating intelligent applications across multiple domains and dimensions.
