## Scoring and Incentive Mechanism

### Sources of Scoring

1. **On-Chain Activity**  
   Key indicators: profit & loss, max drawdown, trading frequency, liquidity provision.

2. **Dialogue & Community Contribution**  
   Depth of analysis in conversation, helpfulness to other users, knowledge sharing.

3. **Data Contribution**  
   Providing or authorizing on-chain and CEX data, research materials, or specialized datasets.

### Points and AIS Airdrops

- **Points**  
  Each userâ€™s score \(S_i\) is converted into points \(P_i\) via a linear or non-linear function.

- **AIS Airdrops**  
  To reward active participants, AISYNC periodically airdrops AIS tokens to users with high scores, incentivizing continued contributions of data and expertise.

### Secondary Incentives & Profit-Sharing

When a user lists an Agent in the AISYNC marketplace, any resulting fees or profits are automatically distributed via smart contract:

{/* \[
\text{Revenue} = \omega_{\text{creator}} \times R + \omega_{\text{platform}} \times R + \omega_{\text{stakeholders}} \times R,
\] */}

{/* where \(R\) is the net profit over a given period, and \(\omega_{\text{creator}}, \omega_{\text{platform}}, \omega_{\text{stakeholders}}\) represent distribution ratios. */}
