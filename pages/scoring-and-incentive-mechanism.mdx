# Scoring and Incentive Mechanism

### Scoring Calculation

1. **Address Dimension (On-chain Transaction Behavior)**
    - Metrics such as interaction effectiveness, transaction yield, maximum drawdown, average daily interaction frequency, and liquidity contribution.
2. Dialogue Dimension (Interaction Quality)
    - Depth of problem resolution, accuracy of strategy analysis, and assistance provided to other users within the platform.
3. Data Contribution
    - Uploading or authorizing CEX transaction data, investment research materials, etc.
### Points and Airdrops

- Points
    - Users' composite scores 𝑆 𝑖  ​are converted into points  𝑃 𝑖  through linear or nonlinear functions.
- Airdrops
    - In the early stages of the project or during specific events, the platform periodically allocates platform tokens to high-scoring users to encourage professional traders, developers, and researchers to contribute data and knowledge.

## Secondary Incentives and Revenue Sharing

- When users list their Agents on the "Market Center," subscription fees or trading profits generated by the Agent are automatically distributed according to the contract.
